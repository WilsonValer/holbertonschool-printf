.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
Format - is a character string.
.TP
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more sub sequent arguments.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B printf()
produces output according to a format given. Returns the
number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to
strings). The function
.B _printf()
write output to stdout, the standard output stream.
.SS Format

.IP \[bu] 2
c:
A single character
.IP \[bu] 2
s:

.SH BUGS
we found any difference between loop for and while, because the while count his
iterator finishing the function , but the loop for finish the iterator at the begin. this was compliacate for us becouse the length of the string was difference.
